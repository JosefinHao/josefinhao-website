    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Hi, I'm Josefin!</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a data scientist and AI engineer with a passion for building intelligent systems
        that solve real-world problems. My background combines quantitative finance, machine
        learning, and full-stack development—with a Master's degree in Financial Mathematics
        from Uppsala University, where I graduated with a perfect 4.0 GPA.
    </p>

    <h2>Recent Work</h2>
    <p>
        Most recently, I led the data science R&D domain at OKX, one of the world's largest
        cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume. I established and directed research initiatives
        to identify revenue growth drivers for institutional clients, built client segmentation
        models using advanced clustering techniques, and developed automated reporting systems
        that reduced manual effort by 95%. I also led a team of analysts, collaborated directly
        with crypto hedge funds and broker firms, and designed training programs for the global team.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before that, I worked as a quantitative developer at Handelsbanken Capital Markets in Stockholm,
        where I built and maintained proprietary interest rate derivative pricing models for fixed
        income traders. I've also conducted independent trading and quantitative research, developing
        price-action strategies for options trading with extensive backtesting and optimization.
    </p>

    <h2>Current Focus</h2>
    <p>
        These days, I'm focused on building advanced AI systems—particularly multi-agent architectures
        for data exploration, causal inference, and predictive modeling. I'm also developing a
        GPT-backed financial advisor application and training domain-specific AI models to enhance
        contextual understanding. You can see more details about my projects on the
        <a href="/projects" style="color: #ec407a; text-decoration: none; font-weight: 500;">Projects page</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Technical Expertise</h2>
    <p>
        My technical toolkit spans Python, SQL, R, C#, JavaScript, and various machine learning
        frameworks. I specialize in statistical modeling, algorithmic trading, blockchain technology,
        and agentic AI systems. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of AI, DeFi, and
        automated decision-making systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Beyond Code</h2>
    <p>
        I'm fluent in English, Swedish, and Chinese, which has given me the opportunity to work
        with global teams across multiple continents. When I'm not coding or analyzing data, you'll
        find me exploring new places, playing piano, or diving deep into the latest developments
        in blockchain and decentralized finance.
    </p>

    <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
    <p>
        I'm always interested in hearing about new opportunities, collaborations, and innovative
        projects. Whether you want to discuss AI systems, trading strategies, or potential
        partnerships, feel free to
